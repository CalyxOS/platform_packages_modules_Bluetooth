      "message": "Not immediately ready for use, but submitting for possible reference in the future.\n\nAn example use case is being able to use a Bluetooth headset during a Signal call when Signal is in a work profile. In 12L, this is not ordinarily possible.\n\nThis compiles and, at least in 12L, it works (not verified for 13); however, it leads to behavior that is *more permissive* than AOSP. If this is implemented, it would likely be better to gatekeep it via a per-profile setting for Bluetooth similar to the per-profile Location option that is adjustable via Apps \u0026 content.\n\nCode-wise, the functions this adds and uses for checking access are likely poorly-named, and the function used previously is simply mass-replaced by the new one; so, the code would likely also need to be reworked.",
